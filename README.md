# base-react-001

This is a template site that works as-is and enables you to quickly build a website/app with menu and multiple pages that functions both in a browser and on mobile devices, and can be published for free to a public URL hosted at Netlify.

The following technlogies are used and tested to work together:

- React (based on create-react-app)
- TypeScript
- SASS
- Bootstrap
- JQuery
- ESLint
- React Router
- Responsive Bootstrap Navbar with three sample pages
- One page reads data from a JSON file and displays it on the page with graphics
