# base-react-001

This is a template site that works as-is and enables you to quickly build upon it a website/app with menu and multiple pages that functions both in a browser and on mobile devices, and can be published for free to a public URL hosted at Netlify.

This is a useful base site if you are new to React and want to start with a project that already has numerous useful technologies and features working together in a functional site that can be published online for free.

**Technologies:**

- React (based on create-react-app)
- React Router

- JQuery
- ESLint

**Features:**
- single page application with responsive Bootstrap/React-Router menu
	- each page has an individually configurable title for browser tabs and bookmarking
	- browser back button works
	- three sample pages
- one page reads from a JSON file and displays contents on page with graphics
- pages have internal links from one page to the next
- a customizable favicon that shows up in bookmarks and browser tabs
